Manchester United produced yet another memorable performance and result in a local derby as the Reds deservedly ran out 2-0 winners over the Blues.
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men took the lead in the second minute thanks to a Bruno Fernandes penalty after Anthony Martial was fouled in the box.
The Reds had to withstand some heavy pressure from the hosts, but we always looked dangerous on the break. And five minutes into the second period United grabbed a second from an unlikely source as Luke Shaw linked up superbly with Marcus Rashford before steering the ball home.
